      # Midi rules.
      rules:
        # This is tricky but once mastered, a convenient way to
        # describe MIDI events.
        #
        # Each key  is the name  of the event, combined  with the
        # device  name it  is later  used in  the live  config as
        # MNEMOs  (for  instance here,  if  the  rule matches,  a
        # "electribe.kick"  event will  be  emited to  interested
        # mods).
        #
        # The value has the following form: mask/value where:
        #
        # - mask is a binary mask,
        # - value is the expected value once masked.
        #
        # For instance, the MIDI event "Note on channel 9" can be
        # expressed has follow:
        #
        # 0xFF000000/0x98000000
        #
        # 0xFF000000 will retain only the first byte of the MIDI
        # event. A MIDI "note on" event matches "0x90", a MIDI
        # event on channel "9" matches "0x08", so we get both by
        # using 0x98000000 as a value.
        kick: "0xFF000000/0x98000000"
        bass: "0xFF000000/0x92000000"
        motive: "0xFF000000/0x94000000"
