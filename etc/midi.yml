      # This is tricky but once mastered, a convenient way to
      # describe MIDI events.
      #
      # Each key is the name of the event, combined with the device
      # name it is later used as MNEMOs (for instance here, if the
      # rule matches, a "digitakt.kick" event will be emited to
      # interested mods).
      #
      # The value has the following form: mask/value where:
      #
      # - mask is a binary mask,
      # - value is the expected value once masked.
      #
      # For instance, the MIDI event "Note on channel 9" can be
      # expressed has follow:
      #
      # 0xFF000000/0x98000000
      #
      # 0xFF000000 will retain only the first byte of the MIDI
      # event. A MIDI "note on" event matches "0x90", a MIDI event on
      # channel "9" matches "0x08", so we get both by using 0x98000000
      # as a value.

      # MIDI A note ON.
      "kick":  "0xFF000000/0x90000000"
      # MIDI B note ON.
      "snare": "0xFF000000/0x91000000"
