# Quick Start

## Installation

!!! note "Time to Get Your Hands Dirty!"
    The `soir` installation process is currently manual and requires a
    bit of hands-on configuration. This is intentional - we believe in
    transparency and want you to understand how everything works under
    the hood. Consider this an opportunity to explore, tinker, and
    truly make `soir` your own.

Go to the [release page of
soir](https://github.com/aimxhaisse/soir/releases) and download the
archive that corresponds to your platform, then create the `soir` directory
and extract the archive in it. 

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.soir
tar -zcvf soir-version-arch-os.tar.gz -C ~/.soir
```

Add the soir bin path to your environment, you can consider adding it
to your shell RC configuration file as well:

```bash
export PATH="~/.soir/bin:$PATH"
```

Now you can run `soir` for the first time, it will create a Python
virtual environment with all required dependencies on the first run,
then your setup is ready!
