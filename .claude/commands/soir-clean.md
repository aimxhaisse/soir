The goal of this command is to clean up recent changes and make sure
they are well formatted and linted.

There is an existing command 'just check' in the repository that will
run existing tools to verify the entire codebase. Your goal is to
address those comments and provide a straightforward and simple fix
for each of them which I will manually approve.

When fixing code, it is important you don't add non-needed comments,
this is a stylistic change and it should not change or affect what
the program does or how it works.
